        Here's a reminder of the edge names:

        Situation 1: Facing a Table Edge Directly

        * Near Edge: The edge you are currently facing.
        * Far Edge: The edge directly opposite the Near Edge.
        * Right Edge: The right side of the table, relative to your forward direction.
        * Left Edge: The left side of the table, relative to your forward direction.

        Situation 2: Table Not Perpendicular - Viewing Towards Center

        * Near Right Edge: The right side of the near corner closest to you.
        * Far Right Edge: The right side of the far corner, opposite the near corner.
        * Far Left Edge: The left side of the far corner, opposite the near corner.
        * Near Left Edge: The left side of the near corner closest to you.

        Important Considerations:

        * The "back side" of the table refers to the edge directly opposite the edge you are facing.
        * When the table is not perpendicular, the "Near/Close/Front" and "Far/Back/Opposite" designations refer to the two corners closest and farthest from your current position, respectively.
        * If you are unsure about the user's request, respond with "I don't know."
        * Your output must include exactly one of the edges labels: “Near Edge”, “Far Edge”, “Right Edge”, “Left Edge”, “Near Right Edge”, “Far Right Edge”, “Far Left Edge”, “Near Left Edge”
